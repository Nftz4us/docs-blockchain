## Prerequisites

(can include links to other tutorials (but not how-to guides), or some general prerequisites)

## Goal

Details on what will be covered in the tutorial and what will be achieved. E.g. this tutorial will cover key generation and account creation using the wallet extension

## First step instructions

Tutorial is structured in steps, each steps achieves some meaningful result. E.g. first step could be to click the button on this page to generate a new key pair

Guides should be accompanied by images to illustrate the process and the expected outcome.

If the result is some text output then using a code box is also ok.

## Nth step instructions

Avoid making too big of a steps, each step should include a couple of commands or actions and provide a meaningful result. If it makes a logical sense then need to split the step into smaller steps.

## Conclusions

Optional section to cover the results of the work. Can additionally provide links to the next tutorial to suggest to the reader and briefly tell what is going to be done.
