# How to deploy smart contracts on Ultra Mainnet using the Ultra Smart Contract Toolkit Extension

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through deploying a smart contract on the Ultra Mainnet, using the Ultra Smart Contract Toolkit Extension.

## Prerequisites

-   A compiled smart contract (`.wasm` and `.abi` files). Refer to the [Tutorial - Compile Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract Toolkit Extension](../smart-contracts/compile.md) for more information.
-   You must have created your Ultra Pro Wallet. If you need help creating your Ultra Pro Wallet, please refer to [How to create an Ultra Pro Wallet using Ultra Wallet Extension](../guides/how-to-create-ultra-pro-wallet-using-toolkit.md) guide.
-   Your account must have sufficient UOS tokens on Ultra Mainnet for transactions and fees. Refer to [How to buy UOS tokens on Ultra Mainnet using the Ultra Wallet](../guides/how-to-buy-uos.md) guide for more information.

## Deploying on Ultra Mainnet

Deploying a smart contract on Ultra Mainnet is pretty much the same as deploying to Ultra Testnet. Refer to the [Deploy Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract Toolkit Extension](../smart-contracts/deploy.md#deploy-contract) tutorial and follow the deployment steps.

_The only thing you need to ensure is to select the `Ultra Mainnet` endpoint every time you are prompted to select an environment/endpoint._
