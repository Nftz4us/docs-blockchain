# Uniq Factories

A uniq factory also known as a token factory is our non-fungible token system that is built on top of Ultra's blockchain.

## Uniqs

A Uniq is a unique digital asset representing ownership or authenticity proof using blockchain. Stored on a decentralized ledger, each uniq has a verifiable and tamper-proof transaction history, ensuring transparency. Uniqs can represent digital or physical items, and their ownership is facilitated through smart contracts, enabling secure and automated transactions.
