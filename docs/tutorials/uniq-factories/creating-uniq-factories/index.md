# Creating Uniq Factories

We will be walking you through the step by step process of creating your own Uniq Factory on Ultra's blockchain using our very own [Uniq NFT Standard](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/index.md). For the sake of these guides, we'll be using the Ultra Testnet network.

## Prerequisites

-   A basic understanding of [Uniq Factories and Uniqs](../../uniq-factories/index.md).
-   You must have created your Ultra Pro Wallet on testnet.. If you need help creating your Ultra Pro Wallet, please refer to [How to create an Ultra Pro Wallet using Ultra Wallet Extension](../../guides/how-to-create-ultra-pro-wallet-using-toolkit.md) tutorial. Once you have created your account, make sure to [get some UOS tokens for use on Testnet](../../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md#step-3-request-uos-tokens-from-the-faucet). You'll need these to create Uniq Factories and to mint Uniqs.

## Goal

The goal of these guides is to help you create your first Uniq factory and mint your first Uniq.

## Get Started

Here are the steps to get started, and we will guide you through each one. By the end of these guides, you'll have successfully set up your Uniq Factory and issued your first Uniqs on the Testnet network.
