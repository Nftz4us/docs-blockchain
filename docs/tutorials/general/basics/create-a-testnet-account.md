# Creating a Testnet Account

It's easy to create an account on our public Testnet. These accounts are used for interacting with smart contracts, or for deploying smart contracts to.

## Faucets

Ultra provides two types of faucets on our public Testnet.

-   `Account Faucet` - Here you can provide a public key and we will generate an account. Refer to [this tutorial](../../fundamentals/tutorial-generate-key-and-create-testnet-account.md) for details
-   `Token Faucet` - Here you can fund your Testnet account with some fake UOS for testing purposes. Refer to [this tutorial](../../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md) for details

## Using your account with Ultra's Authenticator

We've put together a quick video that illustrates how to import your private key into the Ultra Authenticator.
